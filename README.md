# NI_Trial_Repo
This Repository contains the dataset and results for the NI Trial carried out for evaluation of MO-RL against SO-RL. 

To be specific, we have used Multi-Reward Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MR-POMDP) as an example technique for MO-RL and  Single-Reward Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (SR-POMDP) as an example technique for SO-RL.
